# STOCK_SCREENER
This is my project for jspf application process.
This is a basic version of a stock screener. This was done using python and Flask (micro webservices frame work).
This uses python's data analytics tools a lot to gather data from yahoo finance apis.
The data is then processed to get a plot (for visualization) with some fundamental indicators such as the 200 day moving average, 50 day moving average and index movement.
